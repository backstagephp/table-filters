## Nice to meet you, we're [Backstage](https://Backstage.nl)

Hi! We are a web development agency from Nijmegen in the Netherlands and we use Laravel for everything: advanced websites with a lot of bells and whitles and large web applications.

## About the package

This package makes it easy to add filters to your Filament resource tables with minimal setup.

It allows you to define your table filters externally (file-based), helping you keep your code clean, organized, and easy to maintain.


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require backstage/table-filters
```

## Usage

In your ``ListRecords`` resource page, add te following trait:
```php
use Backstage\TableFilters\Concerns\HasFileBasedTableFilters;

class ListUsers extends ListRecords
{
    use HasFileBasedTableFilters;
}
```

Now if you want to create a file-based Filament Table Filter, please execute the following command:
```php
php artisan make:filament-filter
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
